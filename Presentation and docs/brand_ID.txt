1 Brand Identity and Design

An important aspect of the project development concerned the 
design of a Brand Identity that characterized in an unique 
fashion the final product delivered. The inspirational colors and 
shapes of the whole front-end and presentation stack resembles 
the undeniable suggestion of confidence that IBM first-rate 
services offer. The choice to include a Brand Identity chapter in 
this document stems from the fact that, due to the high 
complexity of the evaluation algorithm, a good visualization mask 
needed to be developed in order to convey the robustness and 
sophistication that the algorithmic part present, while enabling 
not experts of the Machine Learning field to understand the 
potential of this tool.

Certainly, a future possible development is the production (thus 
public distribution) of the platform as example of combined AI 
technologies applied to the real life.

The first choice that the UX unit has taken was to generate a 
palette of colors on which would be later drawn the template and 
the presentation layout. 

As described before, the original colors were taken from IBM 
Corporate Identity and readapted for the project purposes

1.2 Brand creation

Inspired by the name of IBM's utilized service “Watson”, we 
appeal to our project the name “Dr.Watson”, a fictional character 
in the Sherlock Holmes stories by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, while 
GestIT remains the group formal name. 

The brand creation begun with logo's designing. Such process 
included a through research of the main font, later found as 
Merriweather Black and the application of the Palette colors.
